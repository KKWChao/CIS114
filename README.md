# Homework 1 - CIS 114 Homework Page

### Objective:

You will demonstrate your basic knowledge of HTML and CSS

### What you will do:

1. Create a web page, using HTML5, with the heading CIS 114 Assignments. The content of this page can be a list or a table containing the homework assignment numbers which will become a link when you complete and upload the corresponding assignments. You should list all homework assignments (Homework 2 through Homework 8). Homework 1 will not be listed as this web page represents Homework 1. THIS WILL BE THE PAGE YOU WILL SUBMIT FOR EVERY ASSIGNMENT WITH THE LINK UPDATED!!!
2. Embellish this page with some CSS (background color, and/or background image, and/or different font type/size/color, you can think about making each link look like a button, etc.)
3. Create the file for the Homework 2 (you can call it hw2.html).
4. Make sure that you modify the title, and meta description for each of the pages you are creating (Homework 1 and Homework 2). Suggestions when writing the title and meta description for any page you will develop in this course: avoid using CIS 114 as this term is a term only known within CSM community; use words that are well-known such as JavaScript, or JavaScript course at CSM, or etc. Remember that the meta description is used by Google search engine to describe/summarize the content of your page!
5. The Homework 2 page will just contain a heading or a paragraph with something as "Coming soon" and a link to the main page (Homework 1 page) so the user can go back to the main page without the need to use the back button of the browser (this is part of offering good user experience, a good navigation system so the user will not depend on back button of the browser to navigate through your site)!
6. Save each file to your computer and then upload all the files (hw1.html or index.html and hw2.html) to your web server. Remember to also upload any image that you might have used on your page(s)! Of course, when Homework 2 comes, you will modify the content of that page (hw2.html)!
7. After you upload to the server, test both pages in the browser and make sure the hyperlinks are working correctly (going to Homework 2 page from Homework 1 and going to Homework 1 page from Homework 2 page). Make sure those hyperlinks are NOT opening in a new tab/window as you do not want the user to have multiple tabs opened after navigating your website!
8. I suggest that you validate your Homework 1 page for HTML5 and CSS using W3C ValidatorLinks to an external site.. You should use the validator as a tool to help write HTML and CSS following the latest standards from W3C.
9. Remember to use HTML5 and also the two important meta tags (charset and description)
   If you need help in fixing validation errors, as noted from the validator, then you should post your doubt in the forum so other students can help you out.

### To submit your work:

1. Once you upload your Homework 1 page and Homework 2 page, remember to test in the browser!
2. If everything is ok, copy the URL of your Homework 1 page and paste it in the box provided to submit your assignment
3. Click the "Submit assignment" button to submit your assignment.

### Checklist for grading:

- your page opens in the browser with no errors (NOT FOUND or FORBIDDEN) - 2 points
- you are not opening the links in different tab/window of the browser (the user should not have tons of tabs/windows opened after navigating your own website, unless you would be opening a link to another website that is not yours) - 1 point
- your HTML5 and CSS code are valid - 5 points
- The links are working correctly (from Homework 1 to Homework 2 and from Homework 2 to Homework 1). Navigation looks good (the user will be able to go back to the main page - Homework 1 - without using the back button of the browser) - 2 points
